AC/DC Motor control using a Cypress PSOC5

Based on STMBL:
https://github.com/rene-dev/stmbl

This version uses only fixed point operations, and is suitable for Cortex-M3
chips.

The current design supports simultaneous drive of either two AC (PMSM) servos,
or four DC servos.

This is designed to work with g2_core using I2C in UFM mode for control.
